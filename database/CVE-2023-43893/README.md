## Proof-of-Concept Exploit
### Description
The vulnerability is found in the "wakeup_mac" parameter within the Wake-On-LAN functionality of the Netis N3Mv2-V1.0.1.865 router. By injecting arbitrary OS commands into this parameter, attackers can potentially execute these commands on the router, posing significant security risks.

### Usage/Exploitation
#### Step 1: Connect to the Router
- Ensure you have access to the Netis N3Mv2-V1.0.1.865 router's network.
- Open the router's web interface through a browser.

#### Step 2: Navigate to Wake-On-LAN Settings
- Log into the administrative console of the router.
- Find the Wake-On-LAN (WoL) settings.

#### Step 3: Command Injection in wakeup_mac Parameter
- In the Wake-On-LAN settings, locate the "wakeup_mac" field.
- Input a command injection payload in the "wakeup_mac" parameter. Example:
  ```
  `reboot` # An example command to test the vulnerability
  ```

#### Step 4: Execute and Observe
- Apply the settings containing the payload.
- Monitor the router for signs of command execution, like an unexpected reboot or other unusual behavior.
