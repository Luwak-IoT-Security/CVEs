## Proof-of-Concept Exploit
### Description
The buffer overflow vulnerability in the "pingWdogIp" parameter of the router's firmware can be exploited by providing maliciously crafted input. This vulnerability, when triggered, can disrupt the router's normal operation and may lead to a DoS condition.

### Usage/Exploitation
#### Step 1: Access the Router Interface
- Connect to the Netis N3Mv2-V1.0.1.865 router network.
- Navigate to the router's web interface in a web browser.

#### Step 2: Locate the Vulnerable Setting
- Log into the router's administrative panel.
- Find the setting where the "pingWdogIp" parameter is configured.

#### Step 3: Prepare the Malicious Input
- Create an input string that is longer than the buffer allocated for the "pingWdogIp" parameter.
- Inject this string into the "pingWdogIp" field.

#### Step 4: Execute and Observe
- Submit the settings with the long input string.
- Watch for any signs of the router becoming unresponsive or crashing, indicating successful exploitation.
