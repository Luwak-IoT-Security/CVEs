## Proof-of-Concept Exploit
### Description
The vulnerability exists in the "pin_host" parameter within the router's WPS settings. An attacker can inject arbitrary OS commands into this parameter, exploiting insufficient input validation and potentially gaining unauthorized access and control over the device.

### Usage/Exploitation
#### Step 1: Access Router's Web Interface
- Connect to the Netis N3Mv2-V1.0.1.865 router.
- Navigate to the router's web interface through a browser.

#### Step 2: Locate WPS Settings
- Log in to the router's administrative panel.
- Go to the WPS settings area.

#### Step 3: Inject Command in pin_host Parameter
- In the WPS settings, locate the "pin_host" field.
- Enter a command injection payload in the "pin_host" parameter, like:
  ```
  `reboot` # An example payload to test the vulnerability
  ```

#### Step 4: Monitor for Router Response
- Apply the settings with the injected command.
- Watch for any unusual behavior from the router, such as an unintended reboot, indicating successful command execution.
