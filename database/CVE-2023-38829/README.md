## Proof-of-Concept Exploit
### Description
The following Proof-of-Concept (PoC) exploit demonstrates the command injection vulnerability in the NETIS SYSTEMS Router WF2409E.

### Usage/Exploitation
#### Step 1: Identify the Target
- Ensure you have access to the NETIS SYSTEMS Router WF2409E (version V3.6.42541) Web admin management interface.

#### Step 2: Open the Ping Function
- Log in to the router's web interface.
- Navigate to the "Diagnostic Tools" section.
- Select the "Ping" function.

#### Step 3: Craft Malicious Input
- In the "Ping" function input field, inject a command. For example:
  ```
  ;ls /* -al|ps
  ```

#### Step 4: Execute the Command
- Submit the crafted input.
- Observe the output. If the directory listing of the router's filesystem is displayed, the command injection is successful.

#### Step 5: Open the Traceroute Function
- Navigate back to the "Diagnostic Tools" section.
- Select the "Traceroute" function.

#### Step 6: Craft Malicious Input
- In the "Traceroute" function input field, inject a command. For example:
