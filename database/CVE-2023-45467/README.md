## Proof-of-Concept Exploit
### Description
The vulnerability is present in the "ntpServIP" parameter within the Time Settings of the Netis N3Mv2-V1.0.1.865 router. Attackers can exploit this by injecting arbitrary OS commands into this parameter, bypassing insufficient input validation and potentially gaining unauthorized access and control.

### Usage/Exploitation
#### Step 1: Access Router's Web Interface
- Ensure connectivity to the Netis N3Mv2-V1.0.1.865 router.
- Open the router's web interface in a browser.

#### Step 2: Go to Time Settings
- Log into the router's administrative interface.
- Navigate to the Time Settings section.

#### Step 3: Inject Command in ntpServIP Parameter
- Find the "ntpServIP" field in the Time Settings.
- Enter a command injection payload into the "ntpServIP" parameter. For instance:
  ```
  `reboot` # An example command to test the vulnerability
  ```

#### Step 4: Observe Router Behavior
- Submit the settings with the injected payload.
- Monitor the router for signs of command execution, such as an unexpected restart or other behavior indicative of successful exploitation.
