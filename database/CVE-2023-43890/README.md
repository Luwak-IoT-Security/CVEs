# CVE-2023-43890: Netis N3Mv2-V1.0.1.865 Router Diagnostic Tools (Ping and Traceroute) OS Command Injection Vulnerability with Bypassable Mitigations

## Information
**Description:** A critical vulnerability in the Netis N3Mv2-V1.0.1.865 router firmware within the diagnostic tools for ping and traceroute functions, allowing authenticated remote attackers to inject and execute arbitrary OS commands via HTTP. This can lead to unauthorized access or other malicious actions.  
**Versions Affected:** Netis N3Mv2-V1.0.1.865  
**Version Fixed:** Information not available at the time of this disclosure

## Proof-of-Concept Exploit
### Description
The OS command injection vulnerability is found in the ping and traceroute diagnostic tools. Despite some mitigation measures like filtering certain characters (space, '|', ';', '&'), the firmware does not block backticks ('`') and dollar signs ('$'), enabling command injection attacks. The vulnerability allows attackers to execute commands with root privileges.

### Vulnerability Details

This is the vulnerable part of the code:

```
undefined4 FUN_0040bd60(undefined4 param_1,undefined4 param_2)

{
  int iVar1;
  char *pcVar2;
  char *__nptr;
  size_t sVar3;
  hostent *phVar4;
  uint local_a8;
  char acStack148 [136];
  
  memset(acStack148,0,0x80);
  iVar1 = access("/tmp/result",0);
  if (iVar1 != 0) {
    remove("/tmp/result");
  }
  pcVar2 = (char *)FUN_00404308(param_1,param_2);
  iVar1 = atoi(pcVar2);
  if (iVar1 != 0) {
    pcVar2 = (char *)FUN_00404308(param_1,"IpAddr");
    __nptr = (char *)FUN_00404308(param_1,&DAT_00416544);
    iVar1 = atoi(__nptr);
    for (local_a8 = 0; sVar3 = strlen(pcVar2), local_a8 < sVar3; local_a8 = local_a8 + 1) {
      if ((((pcVar2[local_a8] == ' ') || (pcVar2[local_a8] == '|')) || (pcVar2[local_a8] == ';')) ||
         (pcVar2[local_a8] == '&')) {
        RunSystemCmd("echo \'\' > %s &","/tmp/result");
        return 0x7e;
      }
    }
    if (iVar1 == 1) {
      sprintf(acStack148,"ping -c 4 -s 56 %s -W 1000 > %s &",pcVar2,"/tmp/result");
    }
    else if (iVar1 == 2) {
      sprintf(acStack148,"traceroute -I -m 20 %s > %s &",pcVar2,"/tmp/result");
      phVar4 = gethostbyname(pcVar2);
      if ((phVar4 != (hostent *)0x0) && (phVar4->h_addrtype == 10)) {
        sprintf(acStack148,"rltraceroute6 -I -m 20 %s > %s &",pcVar2,"/tmp/result");
      }
    }
    system(acStack148);
  }
  return 0x7e;
}
```
We can see that it already implements some kind of filter for space, |, ;, and &:
``` 
for (local_a8 = 0; sVar3 = strlen(pcVar2), local_a8 < sVar3; local_a8 = local_a8 + 1) {
      if ((((pcVar2[local_a8] == ' ') || (pcVar2[local_a8] == '|')) || (pcVar2[local_a8] == ';')) ||
         (pcVar2[local_a8] == '&')) {
        RunSystemCmd("echo \'\' > %s &","/tmp/result");
        return 0x7e;
      }
    }
```
However, the problem with this vulnerability is that it doesn't block backticks '`' and dollar signs '$', which can also be used for attacks, including command injection.

To enhance security, it's advisable to use a 'whitelisting' approach instead of 'blacklisting'. Whitelisting means specifying which characters or patterns are allowed, making it much harder for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities, including command injection.


### Usage/Exploitation
#### Step 1: Access the Diagnostic Tools
- Log in to the router's web interface.
- Navigate to the diagnostic tools for ping and traceroute.

#### Step 2: Crafting the Injection
- Prepare a command injection payload using characters not filtered by the system, like backticks or dollar signs.
- Example payload: 
  ```
  `reboot` # An example command
  ```

#### Step 3: Inject and Execute the Command
- Enter the payload into the "IpAddr" field within the ping or traceroute function.
- Submit the request to execute the payload.

#### Step 4: Monitor the Response
- Observe the behavior of the router for signs of command execution.
