## Proof-of-Concept Exploit
### Description
The vulnerability exists in the "Hostname" parameter within the WAN settings of the Netis N3Mv2-V1.0.1.865 router. By manipulating the "Hostname" field, attackers can execute arbitrary OS commands on the router, leading to potential unauthorized access.

### Usage/Exploitation
#### Step 1: Access Router's Web Interface
- Connect to the Netis N3Mv2-V1.0.1.865 router's network.
- Open a web browser and navigate to the router's web interface.

#### Step 2: Navigate to WAN Settings
- Log into the router's administrative panel.
- Go to the WAN settings section.

#### Step 3: Command Injection in Hostname
- In the WAN settings, locate the "Hostname" parameter.
- Inject a command into the "Hostname" field. For example:
  ```
  `reboot` # Example command to reboot the router
  ```

#### Step 4: Monitor the Router's Response
- Submit the modified settings with the injected command.
- Observe the router's behavior for any signs of command execution, such as an unexpected reboot.
