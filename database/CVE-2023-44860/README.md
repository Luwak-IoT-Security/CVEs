**NIST CVE Link:** [NIST CVE Link](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-44860)  

## Proof-of-Concept Exploit
### Description
The vulnerability arises from incorrect processing of the 'Authorization' header in the Netis N3Mv2-V1.0.1.865 router firmware. If an incomplete or incorrect header, such as 'Digest username="test"', is sent, the server stops functioning, leading to a Denial-of-Service. This issue likely results from the Boa web server's handling of HTTP headers.  

## Usage/Exploitation
To exploit the vulnerability in the Netis N3Mv2-V1.0.1.865 router, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Access the Router's Web Interface
- Ensure you have network access to the Netis N3Mv2-V1.0.1.865 router.
- Open a web browser and navigate to the router's web interface login page.

### Step 2: Craft Malicious Authorization Header
- Prepare an HTTP request to the router's web interface.
- In the HTTP request, modify the 'Authorization' header to contain incomplete or incorrect parameters. For example, use 'Digest username="test"' instead of a fully formed 'Authorization' header.
- This malformed 'Authorization' header can be crafted using tools like Postman, curl, or custom scripts.

### Step 3: Send the Request
- Send the crafted HTTP request to the router.
- The malformed 'Authorization' header will cause the server to improperly process the request, leading to a potential Denial-of-Service.

### Step 4: Observe the Outcome
- Monitor the router's response or behavior after sending the request.
- If the router becomes unresponsive or shows signs of malfunction, the exploit is successful.
