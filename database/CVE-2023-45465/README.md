**NIST CVE Link:** [NIST CVE Link](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45465)  

## Proof-of-Concept Exploit
### Description
The vulnerability lies in the "ddnsDomainName" parameter within the router's Dynamic DNS settings. Attackers can exploit this flaw by injecting arbitrary OS commands into this parameter. The router fails to properly validate input, leading to the execution of these commands, which can grant unauthorized access and control.

### Usage/Exploitation
#### Step 1: Access the Router's Web Interface
- Connect to the Netis N3Mv2-V1.0.1.865 router network.
- Open the router's web interface in a browser.

#### Step 2: Navigate to Dynamic DNS Settings
- Log in to the router's admin panel.
- Go to the Dynamic DNS (DDNS) settings.

#### Step 3: Inject Command in ddnsDomainName Parameter
- In the "ddnsDomainName" input field, craft a command injection payload. For example:
  ```
  `reboot` # Example payload
  ```
- The above command, when processed, may cause the router to reboot.

#### Step 4: Observe the Effect
- After submitting the payload, monitor the router's response.
- Successful exploitation may result in unexpected behaviors depending on the injected command.
